# Scheduled_Facebook_Messenger_Bot
This is a pretty straight forward and simple bot that sends out an automatic message at specific times of day or week
You should use Cron job for scheduling purposes but you can also use python function i wrote which i dont recommend because it tends to slow your computer down a bit..
